This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Folder structure

- `src/pages`: NextJS file-routed pages.
- `src/hooks`: Reusable hooks.
- `src/components`: Reusable components.
- `src/fragments`: Like components, but page-specific. These are not necessarily
  designed to be reusable in other pages than the one they were built for.
- `src/utils`: Utility functions and classes, plux Redux stuff for some reason.
